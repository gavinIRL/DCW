# This class will create a schema for how a ping-pong bot functions
# The idea will be to have an object that can be iteratively created
# And can have as many or few indicators to utilise
# It will generally work by being fed a timepoint in the evaluator class
# And then make a decision on whether to buy (if funds exist to buy)
# Or alternatively sell if funds exist to sell
