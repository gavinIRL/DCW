# This class will provide the functions for evaluating a bot object
# It will be called by the playground object
# It will randomly select existing data
# And then apply the given bot object to calculate when a buy/sell occurs
# Calculate the metrics associated with the given bot behaviour
# And then finally pass performance metrics back to the playground object
