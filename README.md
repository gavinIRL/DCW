# DCW
DesktopCryptoWatcher - Basic desktop GUI to pull and store data from multiple public APIs and display data such as your personal earnings/losses.

Note: This is a simple application for my own personal use, and I'm using this mostly as a learning opporunity, I wanted to create my own application from scratch instead of using existing wrappers or software. I'll probably keep this ticking over in the background with small feature additions once the basic functionality has been implemented.

## Implemented features:
1) Home screen containing information from the past day for top 20 currencies
2) Detailed currency analysis page showing percentage change over multiple time periods, multiple RSI indicators for top 20 currencies
3) Detailed chart window that shows a live chart of currency price with updates every 1 second
4) Logging prices of top 20 currencies to csv file for bot training (built into the GUI)
5) Logging prices of top 20 currencies to csv file for bot training (lightweight standalone)


## Remaining Planned Core Features:
This list gets updated frequently as some features are moved up or down the priority queue based on personal preference, in particular if there is a bigger learning opportunity as that is the main focus of this project.
1) Bot Sandbox
2) Bot Generator
3) Bot Evaluator
The above features will be added as issues to track their progress. If certain features are taking a long time to develop then additional issues will be added to break down the feature into sub-parts.
## Remaining Planned Additional Features
This list gets updated frequently as some features are moved up or down the priority queue based on personal preference, in particular if there is a bigger learning opportunity as that is the main focus of this project.
