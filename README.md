# DCW
DesktopCryptoWatcher - Basic desktop GUI to pull and store data from Nomics API and display earnings/losses

## Planned features:
1) Home screen containing information from the past day for limited number of user-selected currencies
2) Ability to add when a currency was bought and profit/loss since that point
3) Detailed currency analysis page showing RSI, etc. for multiple currencies
4) Profit/loss trading versus simply hodling with bitcoin or another currency
5) Eventual integration with a trend-tracker which can evaluate profit/loss for a user-defined buy/sell routine e.g. buy at 9am Monday and Sell 2pm Thursday

The above features will be added as issues to track their progress. If certain features are taking a long time to develop then additional issues will be added to break down the feature into sub-parts.
