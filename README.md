# DCW
DesktopCryptoWatcher - Basic desktop GUI to pull and store data from multiple public APIs and display data such as your personal earnings/losses.

Note: This is a simple application for my own personal use, and I'm using this mostly as a learning opporunity, I wanted to create my own application from scratch instead of using existing wrappers or software. I'll probably keep this ticking over in the background with small feature additions once the basic functionality has been implemented.

## Planned features:
1) Home screen containing information from the past day for limited number of user-selected currencies
2) Ability to add when a currency was bought and profit/loss since that point
3) Detailed currency analysis page showing RSI, etc. for multiple currencies
4) Profit/loss trading versus simply hodling with bitcoin or another currency
5) Eventual integration with a trend-tracker which can evaluate profit/loss for a user-defined buy/sell routine e.g. buy at 9am Monday and Sell 2pm Thursday

The above features will be added as issues to track their progress. If certain features are taking a long time to develop then additional issues will be added to break down the feature into sub-parts.

## Multiple API's
The intent is to make use of different API's for primarily the same purpose but also utilising certain ones to their strengths. Also useful for the comparison of prices across API's for spotting trends later. 

Initial API's used are Bitfinex and Binance
